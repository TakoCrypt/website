:::

[Sridhar Ratnakumar][srid] will demonstrate using [[nix|Nix]] to declaratively manage your **dotfiles, programs and services** using [[home-manager|home-manager]], thus replacing the likes of legacy software like homebrew. The goal is to create an **one-click environment** to setup an user environment on any system, be it a Macbook or a Linux machine.

Among the various examples, we will showcase how to configure Neovim declaratively in Nix, and have it work across platforms. In addition, we will show how to use [[direnv|direnv]] to develop projects uniformly across different machines.
