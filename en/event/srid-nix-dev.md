:::

[Sridhar Ratnakumar][srid] will demonstrate the delights of using [[nix]] to [[dev|develop]] Rust as well as [[haskell]] projects without needing to install any toolchain (or do any manual setup otherwise) on your system. We'll start from a pristine [[macos]] machine as well as a pristine Linux machine to get our [[dev|development environment]] up and running in no time, all the way up to [LSP] support in VSCode
